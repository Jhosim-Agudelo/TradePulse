<h2> Curriculum  <h2>

Here is a revised curriculum for my TradePulse project, which is structured to guide you through the entire process of quantitative trading, from data collection and storage to strategy development, backtesting, and risk management:

1. **Data Collection and Storage with Polygon**

   - Sign up for a Polygon account and obtain your API key
   - Explore the Polygon API documentation to understand the available data endpoints
   - Write Python scripts to request, parse, and clean historical financial data from Polygon
   - Store the collected data in a suitable format, such as CSV files or a database

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Load and inspect the stored financial data using Pandas
   - Perform statistical analysis and visualize the data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships
   - Investigate and analyze market behavior, such as price movements, volatility, and trading volume

3. **Trading Strategy Development**

   - Research various trading strategies and techniques, such as momentum, mean reversion, and arbitrage
   - Select one or more strategies that align with your goals, risk tolerance, and trading style
   - Implement the chosen strategies in Python, using the historical financial data for signal generation and decision-making

4. **Backtesting and Optimization**

   - Develop a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of your trading strategies using historical data
   - Test your strategies and analyze the results, including metrics like returns, drawdowns, and risk-adjusted performance
   - Optimize your strategies by adjusting parameters, refining entry and exit rules, or incorporating additional signals

5. **Risk Management**
   - Learn about various risk management techniques, such as position sizing, stop-loss orders, and portfolio diversification
   - Assess and quantify the risks associated with your trading strategies, including market, liquidity, and execution risks
   - Incorporate appropriate risk management measures into your strategies to minimize potential losses and protect your capital

By following this curriculum, you'll gain a deep understanding of quantitative trading and acquire the necessary skills to create and refine your own trading strategies. The TradePulse project will serve as both an educational resource and a practical tool for implementing and testing your algorithmic trading ideas.
